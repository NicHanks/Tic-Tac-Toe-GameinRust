# Intro

Hey there! Welcome to my tic tac toe game in rust! It is super fun and easy to use. 

To start, download the files. Next, download vs code, rust, and the extension for rust in vs code. Then all you have to do is type "cargo run" in the terminal and play the game!

# Things to know

Rust was downloaded and used to compile code. It is not needed to run the compiled code in the file. The compiled code in the file can be ran without rust downloaded. 
Don't forget to use the extensions! Rust.ls, Crate, and Rust Analyser.
Extensions Error Lens and Tabnine might help but are not needed.
